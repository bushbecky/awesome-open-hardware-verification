# Open Hardware Verification

*A curated List of Free and Open Source hardware verification tools and frameworks.*

The aim here is to curate a (mostly) comprehensive list of available tools for verifying
the functional correctness of Free and Open Source Hardware designs. The list can
include:
- [Tools](#Tools) which contain or implement verification related functionality
- [Testbench Frameworks](#Frameworks) which make writing testbenches easier
- [Verification Guides](#Guides) and blog posts on how to actually go about verifying a hardware design
- [Conferences](#Conferences) where new work on open source hardware verification is talked about

## Tools:

For each tool entry, the following information should be included:

**Tag** | **Description**
--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Design Language | Which language(s) does the tool allow you to work with.
Verification Language | Which language(s) does the tool allow you to write your testbench infrastructure in.
License Status | How can the tool be used by others?
Features | What sort of verification functionality is provided by the tool.

## Frameworks:

For each framework entry, the following information should be included:

**Tag** | **Description**
--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
