# Open Hardware Verification

*A curated List of Free and Open Source hardware verification tools and frameworks.*

The aim here is to curate a (mostly) comprehensive list of available tools for verifying
the functional correctness of Free and Open Source Hardware designs. The list can
include:
- Individual tools which contain or implement verification related functionality
- Frameworks which make writing testbenches easier
- Tutorials, guides and blog posts on how to actually go about verifying a hardware design
